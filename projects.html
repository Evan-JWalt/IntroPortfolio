        <p>I thought I had designed the links to open in a new tab, but it's no longer working</p>

              <h2>Pacman Exercise</h2>
              <p>This was the first project I started. The Pacman is designed to create a user-specified number of pacmen that will bounce off the window borders and change direction</p>
              <p>To see how it works, download the relevant files, and run the pacman.html file in your browser</p>

            <h2>Eye Tracker</h2>
            <p>This Is the second project. It is a program that has an eye in the center of the screen and will follow the movement of the mouse.</p>
            <p>If you want to see this program in action, follow the same steps as the pacman project.</p>

            <h2>Real Time Bus Tracker</h2>
            <p>This program makes use of map data to chart the movement of a bus from MIT's campus to Harvards. I still need to refactor this code but do not know how i would do that.</p>
            <p>To run this, follow the others' directions.</p>
