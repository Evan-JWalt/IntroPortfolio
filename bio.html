            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- <p class="title"></p> this title does not need any information and should be updated once I have enough accolades where i'll need a list -->
            <p>I currently work in the Automotive Industry as a repair facility store manager. I mainly oversee the mechanics and the service advisor.</p>
            <p>I tried many times to get a good picture of myself for this page, but I am not very photogenic.</p>
            <p>I learned a bit of coding in C++, Python, and Java while in highschool but have not coded since. this is my first foray into HTML and JavaScript so please do not judge my first website too harshly. I look forward to all feedback on usability and function. I started this program with the intention of making digital inspection software for myself to use for my car at home. </p>
            <p>Another Idea for a project I had was making a shop management system or a service history database, however; I will hold off on that for the time being.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to contact me is by email as I do not use LinkedIn with regular frequency.</p>
